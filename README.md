# TrincaUI
My personal layout for oUF with some extras. It is not very complex, but it has everything that I need.

## Description
  * Minimalist and simple interface using oUF. All dependencies are embedded, so no need to install any extra addon.
  * Most of the code is taken from [ZorkUI](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24252-ZorkUI.html), and also I took some tricks from oUF_Farva. Overall, my intent was to mimic my own configuration of AfenarUI, but using oUF instead of ElvUI.
  * This is always work in progress, so functionalities may be missing and/or may never come. Testing comes from my own personal use, so hopefully it's enough.
  * All config is done in the config.lua file.

## Worthy additions
With the new revamp to Blizzard's UI, I'm using as little other addons as possible. You can check:
